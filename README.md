# Project Name

## Project Overview
This project is a Symfony-based application designed to leverage the power of PHP 8.1 and modern Symfony components. It provides a flexible framework for building web applications with a rich feature set supported by Symfony's robust libraries. Designed with best practices in mind, this project aims to deliver high performance and maintainability.

## Installation
To get started with the project, you need to have PHP (>=8.1) installed on your machine. Additionally, you should have Composer set up as the dependency manager for PHP. Follow these steps to install the project:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

3. Install the dependencies using Composer:
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

4. Set up your environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` provided (not included in the content but generally found in Symfony projects).
   - Configure your database and other service settings as needed.

5. Run the necessary commands to clear the cache and set up the assets:
   ```bash
   composer run-script auto-scripts
   ```

## Usage
Once installed, you can start using the Symfony console commands to run the application, manage migrations, or generate code. For example:

```bash
php bin/console server:run
```

This will start the web server, and you can access your application at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Features
- Built with Symfony 6.4, providing access to the latest features and improvements.
- Supports Symfony Components like Console, Dotenv, and more to streamline development.
